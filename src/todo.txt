Goals
- first select country, then select the timezone, then it should populate the current time it is in that place when you press add
- Make a list that saves when you press add country here, and added a clear all choices button 

Problems encountered:
- Chosen Timezone would not display
    Solution: accidentally put e.target.values instead of value
- Chosen Country would only display abbreviated term
    Solution: Stored the actual object of the country istead of it just being the country 


Goals:
- now actually add the time display for each country
