Goals
- first select country, then select the timezone, then it should populate the current time it is in that place when you press add
- Make a list that saves when you press add country here, and added a clear all choices button 

Problems encountered:
- Chosen Timezone would not display
    Solution: accidentally put e.target.values instead of value
- Chosen Country would only display abbreviated term
    Solution: Stored the actual object of the country istead of it just being the country 

Goals:
- now actually add the time display for each country
- clean up code and organize and digest 

Goals:
- Edit button -> Have the ability to delete a specific one, not just everything (more like checkbox on which ones to delete)
- clear ONLY the checked ones (go through and interate over those ones and remove them)

Notes:
- use the filter tool, no need for iteration 

Problem:
- when deleting the first element in the list, the one behind it becomes checked
Solution:
- the problem was that the index kept on changing in the mapping function because of the delete
- when the index was deleted, the next element takes that (index)

Goals:
- prevented duplicates using .some as a substitute for includes
